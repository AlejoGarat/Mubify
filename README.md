# Mubify

Mubify is a Python API application designed to provide movie recommendations based on ratings and machine learning algorithms using the 20M Movielens dataset. This API will integrate with a frontend and uses CockroachDB in the cloud as the primary database.

## Features

- Offers movie recommendations using machine learning algorithms.
- Planned integration with Spark for better data processing.
- Uses the 20M Movielens dataset for generating recommendations.
- Stores data in CockroachDB, a highly scalable and distributed cloud-based database.

## Application

The Mubify application consists of the following components:

- **Python API:** The application programming interface that handles requests and provides movie recommendations.
- **Database:** CockroachDB is used as the primary database to store relevant movie, user, and rating information.
- **Integration with Spark:** There are plans to incorporate Spark for better data processing and to enhance the quality of recommendations.
